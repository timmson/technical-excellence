## Что такое Разработка через тестирование?

Разработка через тестирование (test-driven development, TDD) это стиль разработки, в котором развитие системы определяется тестамии в коротких циклах:

1. Наисать один тест.
2. Написать только лишь необходимое количество кода, чтобы тест проходил.
3. Провести рефакторинг кода, сделать его "чистым".

В языках программирования, таких как Java, такие циклы занимают не более пяти минут. В старых яызках, с медленной компилцияй и меньшей поддержкой автоматизации рефакторинга, такой цикл занимает больше времени - около 20 минут.

Разработка через тестирование чем-то отличается для случаев крупномасштабной разработки? Нет. Это индивидуальный навык конкретного разработчика, поэтому их количество в продукте не имеет значение.
Объем унаследованного кода, старых технологий, встраиваемого ПО не оказывает влияения на возможность применения unit-тестирования и TDD. Следовательно, большинство экспериментов в это разделе относятся и к таким случаям.

### A TDD cycle Should Be ...

<dl>
<dt>Short</dt>
<dd>The turnaround time for passing each test is short. It could take 5 mins per cycle.</dd>

<dt>Rhythmic</dt>
<dd>You’ll feel the rhythm distinctly - “red, green, refactor... red, green refactor...”</dd>

<dt>Incremental</dt>
<dd>You’ll know that as you write and pass more tests, working functionalities are being build up incrementally.</dd>

<dt>Design-focused</dt>
<dd>With good knowledge of software design principles, you’ll discover TDD is not a testing technique but a method of designing software.</dd>

<dt>Disciplined</dt>
<dd>TDD is a different way of developing software. To break the old habit of "code and fix" and to adopt a new habit will require discipline and persistence.</dd>

## Why TDD?


## Coaching TDD

### Use TDD Coaches

When a client of ours reviewed a draft of the companion book, he mentioned that we ought to stress coaching more. “One of our mistakes is that we didn’t provide enough coaching,” he said. Though we agreed with him, we pointed out that since we are both consultants and provide such coaching, this advice would not be very credible. We might as well add an experiment “Try...Hire us.” Thus, we minimized the advice related to hiring coaches.

But related to test-driven development, we cannot stress strongly enough: Hire coaches! Adopting TDD means unlearning traditional programming and relearning how to design and code. We rarely meet people who were able to adopt this by self-education. Most developers need a coach to pair-program with them for days or weeks. The coach constantly reminds them to write the tests first and to really clean up the code—including the test code. He helps them apply TDD and refactoring to their real code.

Test-driven development might be the hardest agile practice to adopt, but it is also one of the biggest opportunities for improving the quality of the design and code. Hire coaches!

### Internal and external coaches

External coaches are needed when adopting TDD because the com- petence does not yet exist inside the company. But, over time, growing internal coaches reduces the dependence on externals and the cost of coaching.

That said, we have seen several attempts fail to develop internal coaches. Some reasons:

* No structure was in place to decide when and with which teams to work.
* No time was reserved for coaching. Instead the internal coaches were asked to do normal development.
* Developers were less eager to learn from internal coaches...you are never a prophet in your own land.
* Coaching skills were not appreciated and further developed. The result is that skilled internal coaches often leave to be an external coach.

Choose both internal and external coaching. Depending on either of them alone is risky but combining them can lead to good results.

## Test-driven development for a better architecture

TDD can help improve the architecture of a system. How?

When we are coaching, a frequent request is help for dealing with our client’s “inflexible architecture.” This most often boils down to problems in high coupling between components—a common problem in legacy code written without TDD because the original developer did not try to test the component in isolation.

On the other hand, when a developer creates a new component (such as a class) with TDD, or refactors a legacy component to be unit-testable, they must break the dependencies of that component so that it is testable in isolation. That requires designing (or refactoring) for dependency injection and increased use of mechanisms for flexibility: interfaces, polymorphism, design patterns, dependency injection frameworks, function pointers, and more.

In this way, TDD encourages lower coupling and simple, flexible configuration—qualities of a good architecture.
