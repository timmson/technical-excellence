True flexibility (agility) can only happen when you are able to make changes to the product in an easy, fast, and flexible way. In that sense:

Organizational Agility is constrained by Technical Agility

In other words, when you are slow in making changes to your product, then it doesn't matter how you structure your teams, your organization or what framework you adopt, you will be slow to respond to changes.

Luckily, there are clear agile engineering practices that help the team to keep their work in a high quality and in a flexible state. There is no magic to them, most people are able to learn them. However, most people are *not* aware of these after they graduated from university and hence, your organization **will** need to invest in these, usually via [coaching](../adoption/coaching.html).
